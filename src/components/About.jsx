        <p>
        I am a full stack web developer with a background rooted in music and E-commerce. I develop user-centric
         full stack web applications with the client’s needs at the center of attention. With over 10 years of
          experience developing static websites and email marketing campaigns, I have transitioned to being a
           freelance web developer since 2018. Passionate about client satisfaction and delivering the best
            possible products, I work hard to provide solutions creatively while growing from feedback and
             collaborating with others.

        <p>My passion for web development was sparked while developing websites for bands that I was in growing up, throughout my college years and after I graduated. While I was developing static email blasts for a small E-commerce online pet supply shop as an E-commerce listing specialist, I realized that this was the part of my job that I enjoyed most. This triggered me to enroll in General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive program March of 2018. </p>
        <p>Through this vigorous program, I was able to develop a deep skill set with full stack development that I used to launch my career as a full stack web developer. Working as a freelance web developer on several short term projects I was excited to enroll in the Cognizant’s Java Developer Academy to learn a new skill set and interview for the role of a consultant back end developer. While my previous experience as an engineering fellow at General Assembly gave me some knowledge of back end development, I really wanted to learn more about back end development using Java frameworks. </p>
        
        <p>Passionate about growing as much as I can personally and as a web developer, I am willing to work harder than most to achieve my goals while being a strong and supportive team member. I strive to work my way up to becoming a senior or lead engineer and have short term aspirations of becoming a mid-level back end developer. As someone with a background in creative collaboration and problem solving, I am always looking to bring the best version of myself to the table.</p>
